I want to access blog.xyz.com

firt we got to the host file /etc/hosts
root domain . => will forward me to "com"
top level domain (com) => will forwad me to "xyz"
domain (second level domain) ( domain apex ): => will forward me the "blog"
subdomain => i will get ip 


A record  name => ipv4
AAAA      name => ipv6
Cname     name => another name ( doesn't work with domain apex )

/etc/resolv.conf to define or add nameserver (dns servers )
to add search directive => add suffix to your domain 
/etc/nsswitch.conf => to determine the precedence of dns search ( files or dns servers )


nslookup <domain> => get you the ip of the domain from the nameservers only ( not the hosts file)
tool used to troubleshoot the dns issues
